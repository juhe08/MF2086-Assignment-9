#1. Setting up

#1.1 Installing packages (you just need to run these for the first time)
install.packages("ggplot2")

#1.2 Loading necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

#1.3 Setting your working directory
#getwd() #see what your current work directory is
#setwd("//Users/rafa/Box/KTH/2018 IPD-ITM postdoc/Lectures/2019/R/data") #Change "path"
